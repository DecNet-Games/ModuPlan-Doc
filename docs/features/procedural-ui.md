# Procedural UI Generation

Manual UI configuration is slow and error-prone. ModuPlan Pro provides high-end generation scripts using UIElements and `PanelSettings`.

## Bootstrapping 

By simply having a `ModuPlane` component present, the `AppManager` validates null references:

```csharp
if (FindFirstObjectByType<WorldUIController>() == null)
{
     Debug.Log("[AppManager] Re-initializing World UI...");
     if (plane != null)
     {
         ProceduralUIBuilder.CreateWorldSpaceUI(plane, panelSettings);
     }
}
```

## Screen vs World Processing

`ProceduralUIBuilder.cs` processes World Space canvases optimally by binding them dynamically to the 3D plane generated by `ProceduralEnvironment.cs`. It seamlessly sets appropriate render depths without clipping into global lights or overlapping priority over `ScreenUIController`.
