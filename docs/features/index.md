# Core Features

ModuPlan Pro drastically reduces the setup time for interaction logic and procedural UI environments in Unity via 3 fundamental feature pillars:

## [Unified Multi-Input System]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/features/multi-input-system)
A completely plug-and-play architectural binding for Keyboard, Gamepad, and Mouse integration without painful switch statements.

## [Procedural UI Generation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/features/procedural-ui)
Dynamic Canvas scaling over World Geometry and Screen Space rendering that just works when initialized.

## [Advanced Dynamic Resizing]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/features/dynamic-resizing)
8-handle dynamic resizing manipulation built inside a high-performance grid constraint boundary tailored for user experimentation.
