# ModuPlan Pro

Welcome to the **ModuPlan Pro** documentation! 

## Stop Re-Inventing the Interaction Wheel
Tired of writing boilerplate code every time you need an intractable 3D canvas or a multi-input UI? **ModuPlan Pro** gives you a robust, drop-in solution to automatically bind Keyboard, Mouse, and Joystick inputs to World and Screen Space UI.

Stop manual work and focus on building the features that matter!

### Key Features
- **Unified Input System:** Out-of-the-box support for Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepads seamlessly integrated with the new Unity Input System.
- **Procedural UI Generation:** Dynamically spins up Screen and World UI interfaces without the overhead of manual canvas placements.
- **Advanced Dynamic Resizing:** Features 8-handle dynamic resizing (4 corners, 4 edges), grid snapping, and aspect-ratio locks to let users interact with the UI exactly how they want.
- **Architecture & Persistence:** Robust lifecycle management built to survive scene loads and environment resets smoothly.
